            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <p> Hello, everyone. My name is Nastya. I want to tell you about my best friend,
                 my dog Boston. He is two years old. We go to a dog trainer to train him. 
                 Boston is very loved in society, by adults and even children. He is very 
                 kind and loves to communicate with people. I love him very much.</p>
